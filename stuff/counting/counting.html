    <h1>The Counting Game</h1>
    <p>Based on a card game I made up using UNO cards. (This version does not have those.)</p>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>You start with a random card and 5 cards in your hand. You need to place down a card with a number adjacent to the one on the discard pile.</p>
    <p>So, for example, if 5 is the card, you can place down 4 or 6, but not 9 or 2.</p>
    <p>If you can't use it, hold on to it. If you can't go at all, you need to draw cards from the draw pile until you can go, then do your turn.</p>
    <p>"Skip" cards, when played, skip your opponent's turn.</p>
    <p>When you get rid of all your cards, you win.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
