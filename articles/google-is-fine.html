    <h1>Why Google is Actually Not So Bad</h1>
    <p>Now, that probably sounds like the stuff that comes out of a bull's rear end. But it's true.</p>
    <p>Google is not as bad as you might think.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of reasons for this, but I'll give you the big one.</p>
    <p>They only collect data on you from their <i>proprietary services.</i> So they track you when you use Google Chrome or Google Search, but not Chromium, because Chromium is not proprietary, while Chrome is.</p>
    <p>Also, while they do have a large reach across the internet, if you use stuff like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBO</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/">Decentraleyes</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/">DDG Privacy Essentials</a>, I'd say 99-100% of their tracking power is eliminated.</p>
    <p>Finally, just be sensible with what you share online. It's a good rule of thumb anyways.</p>
